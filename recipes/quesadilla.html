        <img src="../images/quesadilla.png">
        <h3>These black bean quesadillas are really cheesy, a little bit spicy, and a little bit sweet. My vegetarian husband goes crazy over them every time! Delicious with salsa and sour cream.</h3>
        <h1>INGREDIENTS:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped onion</li>
            <li>1 (15.5 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed</li>

            <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, or as needed</li>
            <li>8 (8 inch) flour tortillas</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
